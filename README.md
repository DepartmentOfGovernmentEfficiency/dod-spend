# DoD Spending PDF Finder

## Overview
This Python script searches for publicly available **Department of Defense (DoD) spending PDFs** for **FY 2024 and FY 2025** using Google Search. The script extracts direct PDF links and presents them in a structured, color-coded output for easy readability. It also saves the links to a text file (`dod_spending_pdfs.txt`).

## Features
- **Searches for DoD budget spending PDFs** for fiscal years 2024 and 2025.
- **Extracts direct PDF links** from Google search results.
- **Checks web pages for embedded PDFs** if direct links are not found.
- **Displays results in color** for improved readability.
- **Saves PDF links to a text file** (`dod_spending_pdfs.txt`).

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install requests googlesearch-python beautifulsoup4 colorama
```

## Usage
Run the script with:

```sh
python3 dod_spending.py
```

The script will:
1. Search for DoD spending PDFs for FY 2024 and FY 2025.
2. Display the found PDF links in a structured and color-coded format.
3. Save the links to `dod_spending_pdfs.txt`.
